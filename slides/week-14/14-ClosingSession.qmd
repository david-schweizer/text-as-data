## Plan for today

-   Short recap, feedback, & outlook

-   Term paper & data sources

## Short recap & outlook

::: panel-tabset
## I - R & Tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Intro to R & RStudio

-   Import, transform, and visualize data in R!

— These are valuable skills for other seminars, thesis, internships, ...

— Keep improving in R: Keep practicing and work on own projects. For example, at [CorrelAid - Data 4 Good](https://www.correlaid.org/) or creating visualization for \#[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

## II - Text-as-Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Text-as-Data concepts and workflow

-   Various methods: Dictionaries, unsupervised and (semi-)supervised methods, LLMs with R.

— Allows you to implement interesting research questions, follow state-of-the art research, and to collaborate with other researchers.

— More on this for example at [MZES speaker series](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/en/news/events/kolloquium).

## III - Webscraping

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Scraping static and dynamic pages

— Allows you to create your own datasets! Not only relevant for academic researchers but also for policy briefs or news articles.

## Feedback

Overall good, but also room for improvement. Thank you!

## Feedback

-   Trade-off: Topics vs. Pace

-   Probably too much: Webscraping

-   Engaging with the material during the semester

## Term paper - Overview

***In a nutshell:** Ask a question you’re curious about, collect relevant data and analyze them with regard to your question using the techniques learned in this seminar.*

**Proposed structure (see also syllabus):**

-   Brief introduction and research question

-   Expectations / hypotheses

-   Data & Methods

-   Results

-   Conclusion

**3000 - 3500 words** excluding title page, references, and appendix. R code to be submitted separately from the text.

## Term paper - RQ strategies

-   More-of-the-same strategy

-   Recycle and framing strategy

## More-of-the-same strategy

-   Apply existing theory to new data or cases

-   Test existing hypothesis with new data or cases

-   Add a new dimension, new independent variable

-   Add a new theoretical twist to known problem

-   Apply new method to known problem

## Recycle & Framing strategy

-   Challenge and question assumptions or generally held beliefs

-   Or tweak assumptions to generate new ideas and RQs :

    -   Changing context

    -   Changing levels-of-analysis

    -   ...

# How to formulate a hypothesis?

## Concepts & Operationalization

## Term paper - Data

Option A: Webscraping

-   For example, press releases by political parties.

Option B: Text datasets. A few examples (more on the website):

-   [ManifestoVault V1.0: Annotated full-text general election manifestos at the natural-sentence level of three European countries 1970-2024](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/VKQSPO)

-   [ParlLawSpeech](https://parllawspeech.org/data/)

-   [Tweets by members of the U.S. Congress between 2009 and 2019](https://osf.io/pvb6d)

Both options are perfectly fine! Option B might give some bonus points.
