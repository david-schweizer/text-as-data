## General motivation

The goal of this course is to equip you with the skills to:

-   collect your own (text) data

-   tidy, transform & visualize the data

-   analyze the (text) data & communicate your results

-   collaborate with others along the workflow

Taking this course should not be an end in itself.

## Why text-as-data?

::: panel-tabset
#### Data

We can tap into (new) data:

-   Political actors (speeches, press releases, social media, manifestos)
-   Society (surveys, social media)
-   News
-   ...

Everything that is published as text (or can be transcribed)!

## Why R?

::: panel-tabset
#### Benefits

-   Versatile: Visualizations, statistical analysis, programming, incorporation of other programming languages

-   Free and open source

    -   Large community, there is basically an answer to every question you will have online: Stackoverflow, ChatGPT, ...

-   Increasing popularity in academia & industry

## My plan & expectations

-   We are a rather large group. Maybe adaptation is needed during the semester.

-   Mix of lecture-style input, live coding, group exercises, and discussion.

-   Active participation in class and preparation

-   Willingness to invest time to learn a (new) programming language, look for solutions on your own, and keep trying

## Course requirements

::: panel-tabset
## Participation

To get out the most of this seminar, active participation and preparation is needed!

Check the readings, review the code (exercises), make sure that you understand the concepts, and ask questions!

## Assignments

Individual assignments during the semester (need to pass).

There will be 3 (short) assignments during the semester - one for each block. Here, you have to demonstrate that you can apply the concepts/code presented during the session on your own.

## Term paper

**In a nutshell:** Ask a question you’re curious about, collect relevant data, and analyze them with regard to your question using the techniques learned in this seminar.

The term paper can contain up to 4500 words (+/- 10%, excluding title page, references, and appendix). **Deadline: 01.07.2024, 17:00.** 100% of your grade.

In any case, I recommend to discuss your approach and ideas either via e-mail or during **office hours**!
:::

## Organisation & Resources

-   Materials will be provided via the course website.

-   Communication via ILIAS. Make sure that you have access to the course on ILIAS and that emails that are sent over ILIAS are forwarded to the email account you check regularly

-   Weekly office hours before the course. Please make an appointment via e-mail!

## Important!

::: panel-tabset
## Illness (& Covid)

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

## Disabilities

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.

-   And please do this early in the semester so that we can make the appropriate arrangements immediately.

## Support

-   Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable with the question. It is important to note that the **University's Equality and Diversity Office** supports and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The responsible contact person in such a case is **Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfründer**. She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything strictly confidential. No action will be taken without your express consent.
