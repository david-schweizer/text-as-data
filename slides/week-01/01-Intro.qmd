-   Access to Dataquest (Online learning platform for programming languages and more)

## Course requirements

## Important!

::: panel-tabset
## Illness (& Covid)

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

## Disabilities

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.

-   And please do this early in the semester so that we can make the appropriate arrangements immediately.

## Support

-   Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable with the question. It is important to note that the **University's Equality and Diversity Office** supports and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The responsible contact person in such a case is **Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfr√ºnder**. She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything strictly confidential. No action will be taken without your express consent.
