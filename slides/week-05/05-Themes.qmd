## Plan for today

-   Practice: Coding on your own or in groups up to three
-   Input: Text-as-Data concepts
-   Group work: Brainstorming research questions & suitable data (sources)

# Coding

## Practice: Coding

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
## Import & Wrangle

-   Use the data on ILIAS: "btw_2025.rda".

-   Create an East-West variable (0 if the election district is in Western Germany, 1 if in Eastern Germany). Hint: Use if_else() or case_when().
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
## Visualize

**1) Scatterplot:** Show the relationship between the unemployment rate and AfD vote share at the district level. **2)** **Add color:** The dots representing East and West German districts should have different colors. **3)** **Appearance:** Add a title, change the theme, label the axes, ... **4)** **Bonus:** Can you plot this for each party, but keep it in one plot? *Hint: Use facet_wrap()*

# Text-as-Data

## Text everywhere?

Many of our social and political interactions are textual:

-   Political positions and laws are written down üìù
-   (Political) Events are discussed üì∞
-   On- and offline communication üì£
-   History is recorded üìö

These interaction generare huge amounts of data. Analysis at scale has become viable only relatively recently.

## The rise of Quantitative Text Analysis (QTA)

So what has changed?

-   Text is and has become available in a digitized way.

-   Powerful and easy-to-use methods have been developed to analyze this digitized text.

‚û°Ô∏è Researchers can address research questions in social sciences with new and (possibly) better data.

## QTA definition

> "Systematic, objective, quantitative analysis of message characteristics". - *Kimberly A. Neuendorf, The Content Analysis Guidebook*

**Text analysis spectrum:**

Fully manual ‚¨ÖÔ∏è .... ‚û°Ô∏è Fully automated

We focus on automated analysis with varying degrees of human input!

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative

-   All reading of text is qualitative!

-   But there is just so much text a human can read! Quantitative analysis user computer-assisted methods to make sense of large amounts of text.

-   Not mutually exclusive! We often combine both approaches.

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative

But what if political text is published much more frequently?

-   Parliamentary speeches ([ParlSpeech](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN))

-   Press releases

-   Social media data

## Basic assumptions

We assume, that ...

-   ... texts represent an observable implication of some underlying characteristic of interest (an attribute of the author, position, tone, ...)

-   ... texts can be represented through extracting their features, e.g. words.

-   ... we can analyze the frequency of features with quantitative methods to measure these underlying characteristics

## Bag-of-word

-   The simplest possible way of describing a corpus is by counting words. For each text, we record how many times each word appears and we ignore everything else.

**Assumptions:**

-   Words in a document have a meaning.

-   Word order does not matter.

-   Word combinations or grammar do not matter.

-   Words are the only relevant features (no punctuation, etc.)

## Bag of words assumption

1.  "War is good, peace is bad‚Äù
2.  ‚ÄúPeace is good, war is bad‚Äù

|            |     |     |      |       |     |     |
|------------|-----|-----|------|-------|-----|-----|
|            | War | is  | good | peace | is  | bad |
| Sentence 1 | 1   | 1   | 1    | 1     | 1   | 1   |
| Sentence 2 | 1   | 1   | 1    | 1     | 1   | 1   |

Both sentences are exactly the same text for many text-as-data approaches!

## Principles of QTA

**1) "All language models are wrong but some are useful"**

-   Statistical models attempt to describe the ways in which data is generated.

-   This data-generation process is super complex for language (text)!

-   We need to make simplifying assumptions. Therefore, we fail to accurately describe the data-generation process.

-   **Trade-off:** Complexity vs. tractability.

## Principles of QTA

**1) "All language models are wrong but some are useful"**

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
## Example: Sentiment analysis

Customer review 1: "The customer service was terrible. I waited on hold for an hour and still got no help."

Customer review 2: "Oh great, another vacuum that barely picks up dust. Just what I needed."

Customer review 3: "This phone has an amazing battery life and a fantastic camera. I love it."

**Model output:** Negative, Positive, Positive.

Wrong, but useful?

## Principles of QTA

**2) We need domain-specific validation**

-   Methods are easy-to-use , fast, and work at scale.

-   But: Depending on the domain, they might lead to misleading or wrong results!

-   We need to validate our methods in the particular setting we are studying.

-   There are various ways of validation. We will get to know more about this in the coming weeks!

## Validity discussion

Let's say we have developed a method to measure climate change related content in parliamentary speeches at the sentence level. We get a binary measure, that is, the sentence is climate change related or it is not.

How could we validate our results?

## Principles of QTA

**3) Visualization is central to understanding high dimensional data**

-   Text data is multidimensional!

-   One main goal of text analysis is to reduce this complexity into a lower-dimensional representation of the text while preserving the meaning.

-   Visualizing the output of text models is important to see whether we have extracted the "right" meaning.

## Principles of QTA

**3) QTA still requires qualitative interpretation**

-   QTA differs from qualitative approaches:

    -   Analysis at scale of many texts. We do not read every document in detail.

    -   Interpretation of quantitative summaries of text, rather than direct interpretation of text.

-   But: We need to make a qualitative judgement about the output of our models!

## Terminology

-   **Document:** The basic unit (text) of analysis.

-   **Corpus:** A structured set of documents for analysis.

-   **Type:** A unique feature in the corpus. For example, a specific word or N-grams. A bigram (2-gram) is a pair of consecutive words such as "climate change".

-   **Token:** An instance of a type in a document. E.g., the occurrence of the word in a given document.

## "Documents"

A document is the typical unit of analysis. What is a document?

. . .

-   Full speech

-   Paragraphs of a press release

-   Tweets

-   ...

‚û°Ô∏è Depends on research question and design!

## "Features"

How to define "features"?

-   Words

-   N-grams

-   Parts of speech (nouns, pronouns, verbse, ...)

-   Named entities (locations, organisations, ...)

Why might "climate change" be a better feature than "climate"? Has "climate" a unique meaning? Think about the bag of words assumptions!

## There is no one-size-fits-all aproach!

Which documents and features of text would be most helpful for the following research questions?

-   Predicting whether the author of a text was young or old.

-   Measuring the financial content of news coverage.

-   Assessing the relationship between political parties.

. . .

‚û°Ô∏è Selection of documents and features depends on your research question!

## What makes a good measurement?

-   Bias, Accuracy, & Validity:

    -   Am I measuring what I think I am measuring?

    -   Challenging: We need to validate our measures!

-   Variance, Precision, Reliability:

    -   If I measure this again, will I get the same answer?

    -   QTA is usually good at the this when the underlying text is the same. Be aware of changes to the underlying text!

-   This is also a challenge for qualitative approaches: See the [Manifesto project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/down/papers/handbook_2021_version_5.pdf).

## Coding example

Based on the [Manifesto project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/down/papers/handbook_2021_version_5.pdf) coding scheme, could you classify these sentences?

-   We will ensure that all the people of our country can follow the path that leads to a good future.

-   We will make sure that even tenants with a tight budget can have a modern heating system and improved insulation.

-   We will ensure that access to electric mobility makes transportation more comfortable and affordable‚Äîwhether by bus, train, or electric car.

# Group work

## Group work

Up to 4 students:

-   Brainstorm 2-3 research questions

-   How can you operationalize your variables?

-   What might be suitable data to study these questions?

-   Data sources?
