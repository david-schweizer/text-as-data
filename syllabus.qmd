## **Course description**

**\
**Against the background of the ever-increasing availability of
(unstructured) data, the goal of this seminar is to equip you with the
necessary skills to collect large quantities of text, to process it, and
to analyse it. These skills allow you to pursue your own empirical
research projects. The course consists of three major modules and is a
very practical introduction to computational text analysis with the R
programming language.

-   First, you will be guided into the programming language learning the
    fundamentals of R and get to know the workflow for data analysis:
    Import, tidy, transform, and visualize data. No prior experience
    with R is necessary!

-   Second, we will learn how to implement various text analysis methods
    and understand the intuition behind these methods.

-   Third, we will cover static and dynamic web scraping and use these
    tools to collect our own text data.

The goal of this course is to equip you with the skills to:

-   collect your own data

-   tidy, transform & visualize the data

-   analyze the data & communicate your results

-   collaborate with others along the workflow

Taking this course should not be an end in itself. The motivation for
this course is therefore twofold: First, these skills prepare you for
conducting empirical research (including term papers, BA or MA theses),
collaborating with other students / researchers, and communicating your
work. Second, mastering these skills also prepare you for a career
outside academia.

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with the R programming language.

## **Course requirements**

### **Active participation and preparation:**

Active participation during our weekly sessions is important to get the
most out of this course. Engaging with the assigned readings is
essential for participation.

Use ILIAS to post any questions or discuss with your peers if you do not
understand concepts.

### **Assignments during the semester (need to pass)**

There will be 3 (short) assignments during the semester. Here, you have
to demonstrate that you can apply the concepts/code presented during the
session on your own.

Deadlines:

-   Assignment 1: 04.03.2025 after the session until 17.03.2025 13:00
-   Assignment 2: 08.04.2025 after the session until 28.04.2025 13:00
-   Assignment 3: 06.05.2025 after the session until 20.05.2025 13:00

### **Term paper (100% of your grade):**

***In a nutshell: Ask a question you’re curious about, collect relevant
data and analyze them with regard to your question using the techniques
learned in this seminar.***

The term paper should include the following:

-   **Brief introduction and research question:** Here, you should
    introduce the topic you are addressing, your research question, and
    the relevance of your contribution.

-   **Expectations / hypotheses:** This should include a concise
    overview of your theoretical expectation(s) that you are testing.
    What literature do you build on /relate to? A handful of journal
    articles is enough.

-   **Data & Methods:** In this section, you should describe the data
    source(s). Here, you should also discuss the scope of your study
    (e.g., case selection). Descriptive statistics of the corpus might
    be helpful (e.g., speeches: How many speeches delivered overall, how
    many by party, ...). In addition, you should describe the methods
    you are using: How do they help to answer the research question? You
    might want to discuss advantages/disadvantages compared to other
    approaches. Finally, how do you measure your concepts
    (operationalization)?

-   **Results:** Here, you can present (descriptive) empirical evidence
    using figures or tables.

-   **Conclusion:** A brief evaluation of your results and your
    contribution (to to literature). What can we learn from the term
    paper? What might be limitations?

-   Each term paper has to be accompanied by a **statutory declaration**
    in which you assure your **independent working**. The wording of
    such a declaration can be found in the actually valid examination
    order PO: "Hiermit versichere ich, dass diese Arbeit von mir
    persönlich verfasst ist und dass ich keinerlei fremde Hilfe in
    Anspruch genommen habe. Ebenso versichere ich, dass diese Arbeit
    oder Teile daraus weder von mir selbst noch von anderen als
    Leistungsnachweise andernorts eingereicht wurden. Wörtliche oder
    sinngemäße Übernahmen aus anderen Schriften und Veröffentlichungen
    in gedruckter oder elektronischer Form sind gekennzeichnet.
    Sämtliche Sekundärliteratur und sonstige Quellen sind nachgewiesen
    und in der Bibliographie aufgeführt. Das Gleiche gilt für graphische
    Darstellungen und Bilder sowie für alle InternetQuellen. Ich bin
    ferner damit einverstanden, dass meine Arbeit zum Zwecke eines
    Plagiatsabgleichs in elektronischer Form anonymisiert versendet und
    gespeichert werden kann. Mir ist bekannt, dass von der Korrektur der
    Arbeit abgesehen und die Prüfungsleistung mit „nicht ausreichend“
    bewertet werden kann, wenn die Erklärung nicht erteilt wird."\
    Please quote this declaration in German as this is the official
    legally binding language (Analogous translation: I solemnly declare
    that I have drawn up this term paper personally and without help
    from a third part. I also solemnly declare that this paper or parts
    of it have not already been submitted in the same or similar form by
    me or by another person in another seminar. I have made all passages
    recognizable as quotations that I have taken in letter or in spirit
    from the used sources. All secondary literature or other sources are
    verified and mentioned in the references. The same is true for
    graphical representations, images and internet sources. I agree that
    my paper can be sent or stored in anonymous form in order to detect
    plagiarism. I know that the correction of the paper can be refused
    and the examination can be graded as “not satisfactory” if this
    declaration is missing.“)

Overall, the term paper should contain **3000 - 3500 words** excluding
title page, references, and appendix. Please stick to this word limit!
The **title page** should at least include your term paper's title, your
name, the name of this seminar, the semester, as well as the date of
submission.

In addition to the text, you should **submit your R code**. The script
should be neatly presented and annotated. Do not include all code chunks
that you tested but only the ones that you use for your final version of
the term paper.

In any case, I recommend to discuss your approach and ideas either via
e-mail or during office hours!

**A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:**

-   *1,0: Outstanding effort.*

-   *1,3 - 2,0: Good effort.*

-   *2,3 - 3,0: Good/Passing effort.*

-   *3,3 - 4,0: Struggling effort.*

-   *Fail.*

Assessment will be based on several criteria. Given the methodological
focus of this seminar, particular emphasis will be placed on the quality
and rigor of data selection, analytical methods, and implementation. An
overview of the most important grading components is provided below. The
grading related both to content but also takes into account structure
and formal components.
