## **Course description**

**\
**Against the background of the ever-increasing availability of
(unstructured) data, the goal of this seminar is to equip you with the
necessary skills to collect large quantities of text, to process it, and
to analyse it. These skills allow you to pursue your own empirical
research projects. The course consists of three major modules and is a
very practical introduction to computational text analysis with the R
programming language.

-   First, you will be guided into the programming language learning the
    fundamentals of R and get to know the workflow for data analysis:
    Import, tidy, transform, and visualize data. No prior experience
    with R is necessary!

-   Second, we will learn how to implement various text analysis methods
    and understand the intuition behind these methods.

-   Third, we will cover static and dynamic web scraping and use these
    tools to collect our own text data.

The goal of this course is to equip you with the skills to:

-   collect your own data

-   tidy, transform & visualize the data

-   analyze the data & communicate your results

-   collaborate with others along the workflow

Taking this course should not be an end in itself. The motivation for
this course is therefore twofold: First, these skills prepare you for
conducting empirical research (including term papers, BA or MA theses),
collaborating with other students / researchers, and communicating your
work. Second, mastering these skills also prepare you for a career
outside academia.

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with the R programming language.

## **Course requirements**

### **Active participation and preparation:**

Active participation during our weekly sessions is important to get the
most out of this course. Engaging with the assigned readings is
essential for participation.

Use ILIAS to post any questions or discuss with your peers if you do not
understand concepts.

### **Assignments during the semester (need to pass)**

There will be 3 (short) assignments during the semester. Here, you have
to demonstrate that you can apply the concepts/code presented during the
session on your own.

Deadlines:

-   Assignment 1: 04.03.2025 after the session until 17.03.2025 13:00
-   Assignment 2: 08.04.2025 after the session until 28.04.2025 13:00
-   Assignment 3: 06.05.2025 after the session until 20.05.2025 13:00

### **Term paper (100% of your grade):**

***In a nutshell: Ask a question you’re curious about, collect relevant
data and analyze them with regard to your question using the techniques
learned in this seminar.***

The term paper should include the following:

-   Brief introduction

-   Brief theory and hypotheses

-   Research design: Operationalization/Measurement, Case selection

-   Analysis

-   Brief conclusion

The term paper can contain up to 4500 words (+/- 10%, excluding title
page, references, and appendix).

In any case, I recommend to discuss your approach and ideas either via
e-mail or during office hours!

**A general breakdown of scoring is as follows (you will receive a more
detailed checklist for my grading criteria towards the end of the
semester):**

-   *1,0: Outstanding effort.*

-   *1,3 - 2,0: Good effort.*

-   *2,3 - 3,0: Good/Passing effort.*

-   *3,3 - 4,0: Struggling effort.*

-   *Fail.*

#### Submission

**In case of any questions or problems, please get in touch with me as
early as possible.** Late submission will result in grade deductions.

-   Submission via ILIAS (zip folder: This should include your term
    paper as PDF and replication packages).
-   **Deadline:** 01.07.2024, 17:00.

## **Organization & Learning Resources**

**Course website and ILIAS:**

The plan is to use primarily the course website and ILIAS for providing
the structure of the seminar, materials, and communication,
respectively. Nevertheless, you will also receive mails via ILIAS. Make
sure to regularly check your university e-mail address.

If you have contacted me with a question via any channel and you did not
hear back after 2 days (except over the weekend), please just send me
your question again!

**Office hours:**

-   In-person (A 340) or via Zoom, Tuesday 13:45 -- 15:15, please make
    an appointment by e-mail.

-   If you have a specific question or problem (e.g., installing a
    specific package, finding a data source, etc.), please let me know
    before coming to the office hours. This way , I can also prepare for
    it and thereby making our meeting more productive and constructive.

**Illness (& Covid)**

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your
    fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

**Students with disabilities or chronic illnesses:**

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need
    special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses. And
    please do this early in the semester so that we can make the
    appropriate arrangements.

**If you need any support:**

Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable
with the question. It is important to note that the [University's
Equality and Diversity
Office](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gleichstellung/beratung/) supports
and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The
responsible contact person in such a case is Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfründer.
She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything
strictly confidential. No action will be taken without your express
consent. Further counseling services offered by the university can be
found via this
[link](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/studium/beratung-und-service/beratungswegweiser/).

**Readings**
