    "text": "Against the background of the ever-increasing availability of (unstructured) data, the goal of this seminar is to equip you with the necessary skills to collect large quantities of text, to process it, and to analyse it. These skills allow you to pursue your own empirical research projects. The course consists of three major modules and is a very practical introduction to computational text analysis with the R programming language.\n\nFirst, you will be guided into the programming language learning the fundamentals of R and get to know the workflow for data analysis: Import, tidy, transform, and visualize data. No prior experience with R is necessary!\nSecond, we will learn how to implement various text analysis methods and understand the intuition behind these methods.\nThird, we will cover static and dynamic web scraping and use these tools to collect our own text data.",

These skills allow you to pursue your own empirical research projects. The course consists of three major modules and is a very practical introduction to computational text analysis with the R programming language.\n\nFirst, you will be guided into the programming language learning the fundamentals of R and get to know the workflow for data analysis: Import, tidy, transform, and visualize data. No prior experience with R is necessary!\nSecond, we will learn how to implement various text analysis methods and understand the intuition behind these methods.\nThird, we will cover static and dynamic web scraping and use these tools to collect our own text data.",

The workflow is exactly the same as for the 2021 data! So you can just adapt the code from above.\nYOUR TURN!\nYou can add your code to the code chunks below. If you struggle you can have a look at the end of this document. There, you can find helpful code.\nFirst, we need to load the data:\nNext, we need to transform the data again: 1) we want to get rid of all rows regarding the federal and regional level, and keep the constituency level, 2) we are only interested in the “Zweitstimme”, 3) then, select only party name, vote share, and constituency_number, 4) we are only interested in the vote share of the AfD.\nHere, we load the 2017 structural data. Due to the encoding of the csv file this is a little more complicated. So you can just run the code below. However, you have to adapt the file path!\n\n# You can find the data also here: https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/en/bundestagswahlen/2021/strukturdaten.html # you have to adapt the file path\nbtw17_structural &lt;- read_delim(\"C:/Users/David/Downloads/btw2017_strukturdaten.csv\", # you have to adapt the file path\n     delim = \";\",  # set semicolon as delimiter,\n     locale = locale(decimal_mark = \",\", # decimal mark used in the csv file is \",\" and not \".\"\n                     encoding = \"latin1\"), # set encoding due to Umlaute: ä,ö,ü and other special characters\n     escape_double = FALSE, \n     trim_ws = TRUE, \n     skip = 8) %&gt;%  # skip the first 9 rows \n  mutate(constituency_number = as.character(`Wahlkreis-Nr.`)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(constituency_number = sprintf(\"%03d\", as.numeric(constituency_number))) # e.g., this changes the constituency number from 1 to 001, 2 to 0002, etc. We need to to this transformation that we can merge the data frame with the 2017 election data\n\nNow, merge both data frames by constituency number, rename “Arbeitslosenquote März 2017 - insgesamt” to “unemployment_rate”, and create the “east” variable as above.\nNow we can plot our 2017 data! Try to create a scatterplot of unemployment rate and AfD vote share.\nNext, we highlight if the constituencies are in East or West Germany.\n\n\nCombine 2017 and 2021 data\nHere, we combine the data from 2017 and 2021. 1) We start by transforming the data frames separately: We want to focus on the following subset of variables: constituency_number, vote_share, unemployment_rate, east, 2) In addition, we create for each data frame a year variable using “tibble::add_column(year = XXXX)”, 3) we can use the function “bind_rows()” to combine both data frames.\n\n\nPlot using facets\nHere we want to plot our new data frame faceted by year:\n\n\nApply a custom theme\nHere, we load a Google font. You can select any font from here: https://fonts.google.com/.\n\nfont_add_google(\"Montserrat\", \"mont\")\n\n# or try: font_add_google(\"Fredericka the Great\", \"fredericka\")\n# \n\nThe function below activates the loaded fonts.\n\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\nNow, we create our custom theme.

We should not only use filling, but also facets by month. This way, we generate separate graphs for each country. Therefore, we can turn off the fill legend as it has become redundant.\n\nggplot(ess, aes(x = stfdem, \n                fill = cntry)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, \n                 color = \"white\", \n                 boundary = 1) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(cntry))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a density plot, our code is nearly identical to what we used for the histogram. We only change the geom layer:\n\nggplot(ess, aes(x = stfdem)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"grey20\", fill = \"grey80\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can change some of the calculus options if we want:\n\nggplot(ess, aes(x = stfdem)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"grey20\", \n               fill = \"grey80\",\n               bw = 0.5, \n               kernel = \"rectangular\")\n\n\n\n\nAnother way might be to fill by country. It is necessary to make the different layers transparent to a certain degree to see through the whole stack.\n\nggplot(ess, \n       aes(x = stfdem, \n           fill = cntry)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to our histogram, this is difficult to interpret. Therefore, we use facets again:\n\nggplot(ess, \n       aes(x = stfdem, fill = cntry)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(cntry))\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, we can stack the (density) plots behind each other using ggridges. For that to work, we need to map cntry to the y-axis.\n\nggplot(ess, aes(x = stfdem, \n                             y = cntry, \n                             fill = cntry)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.548\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can add further information to geom_density_ridges() with some other arguments like quantile_lines. We can use the quantiles argument to tell the plow how many parts to be cut into. Since we just want to show the median, we’ll set that to 2 so each density plot is divided in half:\n\nggplot(ess, aes(x = stfdem, \n                             y = cntry, \n                             fill = cntry)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, \n                      quantiles = 2) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have good working code, it is easy to substitute in other variables by changing the x mapping:\n\nggplot(ess, aes(x = stfgov, \n                y = cntry, \n                fill = cntry)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, \n                      quantiles = 2) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we can look at the distribution of variables with box plots, violin plots, etc.\nFirst, we’ll make a box plot of satisfaction with democracy:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nWe can switch this to a violin plot by just changing the geom layer:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,\n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\nWith violin plots it’s typically good to overlay other geoms. We can add some jittered points for a strip plot:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_point(size = 0.2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nOverlaying the points directly on top of the violins shows extra information. However, it is also more crowded and more difficult to read. We can use the gghalves package to generate special halved versions of some of these geoms:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_half_point(side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_boxplot(side = \"r\")\n\n\n\n\nNote the side argument for specifying which half of the column the geom goes. We can also use geom_half_violin():\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_half_point(side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_violin(side = \"r\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if we flip the plot, we can generate a rain cloud plot:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_half_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.2), side = \"l\", width = 0.05, nudge = -0.15) +\n  geom_half_point(side = \"l\", size = 0.2) +\n  geom_half_violin(side = \"r\", nudge = 0.2) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n```"

    "text": "In addition, we can look at the distribution of variables with box plots, violin plots, etc.\nFirst, we’ll make a box plot of satisfaction with democracy:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nWe can switch this to a violin plot by just changing the geom layer:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,\n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\nWith violin plots it’s typically good to overlay other geoms. We can add some jittered points for a strip plot:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_point(size = 0.2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nOverlaying the points directly on top of the violins shows extra information. However, it is also more crowded and more difficult to read. We can use the gghalves package to generate special halved versions of some of these geoms:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_half_point(side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_boxplot(side = \"r\")\n\n\n\n\nNote the side argument for specifying which half of the column the geom goes. We can also use geom_half_violin():\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_half_point(side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_violin(side = \"r\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if we flip the plot, we can generate a rain cloud plot:\n\nggplot(ess,\n       aes(y = stfdem,  \n           x = \"\")) +\n  geom_half_boxplot(aes(alpha = 0.2), side = \"l\", width = 0.05, nudge = -0.15) +\n  geom_half_point(side = \"l\", size = 0.2) +\n  geom_half_violin(side = \"r\", nudge = 0.2) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n```"

If you are not yet sure what data you want to work with, you can use one of the data sets of our earlier sessions. For example, the European Social Survey or data from the Federal Election Officer. Other data sources that provide well documented R or csv files are: V-Dem, the Manifesto project, The Populist, or ParlGov.\n\n# import your data here\n\n\n\nInspect the data\nNext, we want to inspect our data. Do we have any missings? Use the str() function and the summary() function.\n\n# insepct data here\n\n\n\nData transformation\nNow, we might need to transform our data. Maybe we have to change character variables to factor variables, or to numeric? Maybe we need to change our data to long format instead of wide in order to plot the data.\n\n# transform your data here\n\n\n\nDescriptives\nNow, we want to plot our main variables of interest descriptively. For example a histogram or a density plot to show the distribution of our data. Maybe, we want to show the development of a variable over time using a line plot?\n\n# plot descriptives\n\n\n\nCorrelation & Regression\nFinally, we want to show the correlation between two or multiple variables. Show the correlation between two variables using a scatterplot. Next, run an OLS regression, plot the results, and visualize them.\n\n# scatterplot here\n\n\n# regression here\n\n\n\nCustom theme\nFinally, create your own theme and apply it to the previous plots! Think about the CRAP principle and our session regarding themes. Of course, you can adapt the code from there!\n\n# plot descriptives"

Instead, we can directly label each of these lines with geom_text():\n\nggplot(gdp_south_asia, aes(x = year, y = gdp_per_cap, group = country, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = country)) +\n  guides(color = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nThe country labels are difficult to see, and we could include more information, like the actual values. Therefore, we use our added columns:\n\nggplot(gdp_south_asia, aes(x = year, y = gdp_per_cap, group = country, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = label_first)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = label_last)) +\n  guides(color = \"none\")\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text()`).\nRemoved 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe labels are still not easy to read as they are overlapping.We can make the labels repel away from each other and randomly position in a way that makes them not overlap using the ggrepel package: geom_text_repel()\n\nggplot(gdp_south_asia, aes(x = year, y = gdp_per_cap, group = country, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first)) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last)) +\n  guides(color = \"none\")\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text_repel()`).\nRemoved 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text_repel()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can force the labels to only move up and down by setting the direction = “y” argument, and we can move all the labels to the left or right with the nudge_x argument. The seed argument makes sure that the random label placement is the same every time we run this (you can use any number you want).\n\nggplot(gdp_south_asia, aes(x = year, y = gdp_per_cap, group = country, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first), direction = \"y\", nudge_x = -1, seed = 1234) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last), direction = \"y\", nudge_x = 1, seed = 1234) +\n  guides(color = \"none\")\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text_repel()`).\nRemoved 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text_repel()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, take the theme off completely and change the colors:\n\nggplot(gdp_south_asia, aes(x = year, y = gdp_per_cap, group = country, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first), direction = \"y\", nudge_x = -0.5, seed = 1234) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last), direction = \"y\", nudge_x = 0.3, seed = 1234) +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"magma\", end = 0.9) +\n  theme_void()\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text_repel()`).\nRemoved 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_text_repel()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBump charts\nBump charts show us changes in rankings over time. Here, we examine \\(CO_2\\) emissions in South Asia. - First we calculate a new variable that shows the rank of each country within each year - To do so, we group by year and then use the rank() function to rank countries by the co2_emissions column. By adding the “-” in front of the co2_emissionsvariable, we order from highest to lowest.\n\nsa_co2 &lt;- wdi_clean %&gt;% \n  filter(region == \"South Asia\") %&gt;% \n  filter(year &gt;= 2005, year &lt; 2015) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(rank = rank(-co2_emissions))\n\nWe then plot the data using lines (geom_line()) and points (geom_point()). Additionally, we reverse the y-axis so 1 is at the top.\n\nggplot(sa_co2, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:8)\n\n\n\n\nAs with the slopegraph, we have many different colors in our legend. Instead of lining them up with the respective plot lines, we use geom_text() again. We don’t need to repel anything, since the text should fit in each row. However, we need to change the data argument in geom_text() and filter the data to only include one year, otherwise we would get labels on every point in the plot By adjusting the theme and colors, we can give the plot a cleaner look.\n\nggplot(sa_co2, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 2) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  geom_text(data = filter(sa_co2, year == 2005),\n            aes(label = iso2c, x = 2004.25),\n            fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = filter(sa_co2, year == 2014),\n            aes(label = iso2c, x = 2014.75),\n            fontface = \"bold\") +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2005:2014) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"magma\", begin = 0.2, end = 0.9) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Rank\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nWe could even use flags instead of country codes. This requires the ggflags package and a little more work. YOu can find a detailled example here: https://dominikkoch.github.io/Bump-Chart/\nWe can to the same using the ggbump package: https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggbump.\n\nggplot(sa_co2, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country)) +\n    # we can also just use the geom_bump function!\n    geom_bump() +\n    # we reverse the y-axis that the highest emissions are on top\n    scale_y_reverse()"

Therefore, we have to check, if a party is actually Eurosceptic at the particular election.\n\n\n# we \"overwrite\" the parl_pop dataframe\nparl_pop &lt;- parl_pop %&gt;% \n  # we create a variable called \"Eurosceptic\" that takes the value \"1\" if \n  # it the party was considered eurosceptic before and after the election\n  mutate(Eurosceptic = case_when(election_date &gt;= eurosceptic_start & election_date &lt;= eurosceptic_end ~ 1,\n                                 TRUE ~ 0))\n\n\nNow, we can restrict the dataset to the variables we are interested in for plotting!\n\n\n# we create a new dataframe\nparl_pop_plot &lt;- parl_pop %&gt;% \n  # we select only the variables we need for our first plot\n  # and rename some of them in one step!\n  # dplyr:select(new_name = old_name)\n  dplyr::select(country = country_name.x,\n                election_date,\n                vote_share,\n                Eurosceptic) \n\n\nAs a last step, we need to summarize the vote shares of all Eurosceptic parties for each election.\n\n\n# We \"overwrite\" our existing data frame\nparl_pop_plot &lt;- parl_pop_plot %&gt;% \n  # before we summarize, we need to group our variables\n  group_by(country, election_date, Eurosceptic) %&gt;% \n  # now we can summarize, na.rm = TRUE omits NAs during the calculation\n  # this is important as some vote_shares are missing\n  summarize(Vote_share = sum(vote_share, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'election_date'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\nPlot\nFinally, we can plot the vote share of Eurosceptic parties in West European countries over time!\n\n# here, we are only interested in the vote share of Eurosceptic parties\n# We create a new dataframe called \"Eurosceptic_vote\"\nEurosceptic_vote &lt;- parl_pop_plot %&gt;% \n  # and filter that we keep the Eurosceptic observations\n  filter(Eurosceptic == 1) %&gt;% \n  # and change election_date to date format\n  mutate(election_date = as.Date(election_date))\n\n# Now we can plot these vote shares of Eurosceptic parties\n# we need out Eurosceptic_vote dataframe\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       # election_date at the x axis to show the development over time\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           # vote share on the y axis\n           y = Vote_share,\n           # we color by country\n           color = country,\n           # and tell ggplot that we need to group the observations by country\n           group = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nIs a smoothed trend better?\n\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = Vote_share,\n           color = country,\n           group = country)) +\n  # we set se=F to avoid confidence intervals as they would overlap too much\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiples?\n\n# how would you produce this plot?\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = Vote_share)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # we can just use the facet_wrap function to produce these small multiples!\n  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nHow could we make small multiples with sparklines?\n\n# how would you produce this plot?\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = Vote_share)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # again, we use facet_wrap, scales allows us that the y-axis can vary, ncol=3 just defines that we want to facet in 3 columns\n  facet_wrap(vars(country), scales = \"free_y\", ncol= 3) +\n  # theme_void gives us this \"sparkline\" look. We now can only concentrate on the trend. No labels etc.\n  theme_void() +\n  # this makes the header for each facet in bold text\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn: Add manifesto data\n\nFirst, you have to load the manifesto data. You can get the .csv file from ILIAS. Alternatively, you can create a free account here:https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/datasets/MPDS2023a\nIn addition, you need to load the party information from the ParlGov database. This is the right file: https://www.parlgov.org/data/parlgov-development_csv-utf-8/view_party.csv\n\n\n# load the parlgov party and the manifesto data here\nparlgov_parties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www.parlgov.org/data/parlgov-development_csv-utf-8/view_party.csv\")\nCMP &lt;- read.csv(\"MPDataset_MPDS2023a.csv\") \n\n\nNext, you have to get the identifier from the Parlgov party data (cmp), then merge it to the the existing parlgov election data. This allows you to merge the new dataframe with the Manifesto data!\n\nThink first about what identifiers you need to merge theses different dataframes!\n\n\n\n# first, we need the identifier in the parlgov data to merge our exisiting dataframe with the manifesto data! This column is called \"cmp\". You can only know this by inspecting the codebook!\n\n# we create a new dataframe called parlgov_parties\nparlgov_parties &lt;- parlgov_parties %&gt;% \n  # here, we are only interested in \"party_id\" to merge with our existing dataframe, and in \"cmp\" which allows us to link the existing dataframe including the parlgov election data and the populist data with the data from the Manifesto project.\n  select(party_id, cmp)\n\n# now we create the new dataframe called \"parl_pop_manifesto\": \n# we start with the existing dataframe parl_pop (this includes the parlgov election data and the populist data)\nparl_pop_parties &lt;- parl_pop %&gt;% \n  # we then join the parlgov_parties dataframe which includes only the parlgov party identifier and the identifier for the Manifesto data (cmp)\n  # we can left_join by only party_id because it is both in the parl_pop and the parlgov parties dataframe\n  left_join(parlgov_parties, by = c(\"party_id\"))  %&gt;%\n  # now, we could theoretically join the Manifesto data. However, we need another identifier! \n  # in both dataframes, the party identifier appears multiple times. Therefore, it is not clear how to match!\n  # we need a second identifier: the election date - we observe at each election the party once. \n  # this way, we have a unique identification. However, we need to make sure, that the election data has the same format in both dataframes.\n  # it is easiest, to transform both election date variables to the date format:\n  mutate(election_date = as.Date(election_date))\n\n# here, we transform the election date (edate) in the Manifesto Project data\nCMP &lt;- CMP %&gt;% \n  # Note, that the date is provided in a different format here!\n  # We have to tell the as.Date() function the structure: \"%d/%m/%Y\" -&gt; this means for example: dd.mm.YYYY \n  mutate(edate = as.Date(edate,  format = \"%d/%m/%Y\"))\n\n# finally we can join the data frames\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  # the party identifier in the CMP dataframe is called \"party\"\n  left_join(CMP, by = c(\"cmp\" = \"party\", \"election_date\" = \"edate\"))\n\n\nNow, you can proceed as before. Select the relevant variables and plot the salience and positions regarding European integration for the Eurosceptic parties. Here, you can see how these variables are defined by the Manifesto project: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/documents/visualizations\n\nWe can add up the variables per108 and per110 to get a salience measure of European Integration (Salience): per108 + per110\nWe can substract per110 from per108 to get a positional measure of European Integration (Position): per108 - per110\n\n\n\n# select and transform relevant data\n# we \"overwrite\" the parl_pop_CMP dataframe\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  # and only selet the following variables\n  select(country = country_name.x, election_date, Eurosceptic, vote_share, per108, per110) %&gt;% \n  # then, we create the positional and salience measure of European integration:\n  # we get the positional measure by substracting: per108 - per110\n  mutate(position_EU = per108 - per110,\n          # we get the salience measure by adding: per108 + per110\n         salience_EU = per108 + per110) %&gt;% \n  # now, we summarize the measures for the Eurosceptic parites, this is the same procedure as for the vote share before!\n    # before we summarize, we need to group our variables\n  group_by(country, election_date, Eurosceptic) %&gt;% \n  # now we can summarize, na.rm = TRUE omits NAs during the calculation\n  # this is important as some positions might be missing\n  summarize(position_EU = sum(position_EU, na.rm = TRUE),\n            salience_EU = sum(salience_EU, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'election_date'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can plot for example the positions regarding European integration from Eurosceptic parties over time.\nFirst, the position:\n\n! Do you see any strange patterns?\n\n\n\n# again, we are only interested in Eurosceptic positions. Therefore, we filter accordingly:\nparl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  filter(Eurosceptic == 1)\n\n# instead of vote share, we want to show the position regarding European integration on the y axis!\nggplot(data = parl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = position_EU)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # we can just use the facet_wrap function to produce these small multiples!\n  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the aggregated position for France are always zero. The same is true for Germany and Belgium after some time. What went wrong?\n\nUnfortunately, the party identifiers in the parlgov data set seem not to be updated regularly to match the Manifesto party identifiers. You can read more up on this here: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/tutorials/parlgov_merge\nThis means that we would have to adapt the party identifiers of Eurosceptic parties in our parl_pop_parties dataframe before we merge it with the CMP dataframe.\nFor France, we have a different problem. There are two rounds of elections. Unfortunately, the parlgov and Manifesto project use different rounds as election dates. One easy solution might be to transform our data variable to just the year format (e.g., YYYY). This way, we can avoid the problem that the exact dates do not match.\n\nThis is a great example that it is essential that we always check our data!\nAs an example, let’s correct the German data together. How would I tackle such a case?\n\nFirst: Google! This would lead me to the already mentioned blogpost: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/tutorials/parlgov_merge. Here, I could get the right code.\nWhat if Google does not help? We need to check it in detail:\n\n\n\n# first, we want to have a look at the Eurosceptic German parties before we merge with the CMP dataframe\n# this is: parl_pop_parties\n\nparl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  filter(country_name.x == \"Germany\",\n         Eurosceptic == 1) %&gt;% \n  select(country_name.x, election_date, party_name.x, cmp)\n\n   country_name.x election_date                party_name.x   cmp\n1         Germany    1990-12-02             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n2         Germany    1990-12-02            Die Republikaner    NA\n3         Germany    1994-10-16             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n4         Germany    1994-10-16            Die Republikaner    NA\n5         Germany    1998-09-27             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n6         Germany    1998-09-27            Die Republikaner    NA\n7         Germany    2002-09-22             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n8         Germany    2002-09-22            Die Republikaner    NA\n9         Germany    2005-09-18             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n10        Germany    2009-09-27             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n11        Germany    2013-09-22             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n12        Germany    2013-09-22 Alternative für Deutschland    NA\n13        Germany    2017-09-24 Alternative für Deutschland    NA\n14        Germany    2017-09-24             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n15        Germany    2021-09-26 Alternative für Deutschland    NA\n16        Germany    2021-09-26             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n\n\n\nWe can see that “Die Republikaner” and the “AfD” have no cmp identifier! Also we know that the cmp identifier for The Left is 41221. Now, we need to check the party id in the Manifesto data frame:\n\n\nCMP_test &lt;- CMP %&gt;% \n  filter(countryname == \"Germany\",\n         edate &gt;= 1990-12-02) %&gt;% \n  # the party identifier is here called \"party\"\n  select(countryname, edate, partyname, party) \n\n# check the unique party names in the CMP_test dataframe\nunique(CMP_test$partyname)\n\n [1] \"Social Democratic Party of Germany\"               \n [2] \"Free Democratic Party\"                            \n [3] \"Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union\"\n [4] \"The Greens\"                                       \n [5] \"Greens/Alliance‘90\"                               \n [6] \"Party of Democratic Socialism\"                    \n [7] \"Alliance‘90/Greens\"                               \n [8] \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\"          \n [9] \"The Left\"                                         \n[10] \"Pirates\"                                          \n[11] \"Alternative for Germany\"                          \n[12] \"South Schleswig Voters’ Union\"                    \n\n\n\nWe can see that the Manifesto data includes these parties: “The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism”, “The Left”, and the “Alternative for Germany”. However, it does not include “Die Republikaner”. Let’s check now the party identifier for the Left party:\n\n\nCMP_test %&gt;% \n  filter(partyname %in% c(\"Alternative for Germany\", \n                          \"The Left\",\n                          \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\")) %&gt;% \n  select(partyname, party) %&gt;% \n  unique()\n\n                                partyname party\n1 The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism 41222\n2                                The Left 41223\n4                 Alternative for Germany 41953\n\n\n\nWe see that the identifiers for the Left and its predecessor are 41222 and 41223. In parlgov it is 41221!\nThe identifier for the Alternative for Germany is 41953.\nOne approach to fix our problem with the German data can be to change the party identifier for the AfD in our “parl_pop_parties” dataframe accordingly. And the party identifier in the Manifesto dataframe for the variations of the Left. We can do this easily with the case_when() function:\n\n\n# we \"overwrite\" our parl_pop_parties dataframe\nparl_pop_parties &lt;- parl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  # and update the cmp column:\n  # when party_name.x equals \"Alternative für Deutschland\" we replace the value with 41953\n  # otherwise (TRUE) we keep the original cmp value.\n  mutate(cmp = case_when(party_name.x == \"Alternative für Deutschland\" ~ 41953,\n                         TRUE ~ cmp))\n\n# now we change the identifiers for the Left party variations in the Manifesto dataframe:\nCMP &lt;- CMP %&gt;% \n  # when party is either \"The Left \" or \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\" then replace with 41221\n  # Otherwise: keep the original party identifier!\n  mutate(party = case_when(partyname == \"The Left\" | partyname == \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\" ~ 41221,\n                           TRUE ~ party))\n\n\nAfter updating the identifiers, we should be able to run the code from above, merge the data and plot it!\n\n\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  # the party identifier in the CMP dataframe is called \"party\"\n  left_join(CMP, by = c(\"cmp\" = \"party\", \"election_date\" = \"edate\"))\n\n# select and transform relevant data\n# we \"overwrite\" the parl_pop_CMP dataframe\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  # and only selet the following variables\n  select(country = country_name.x, election_date, Eurosceptic, vote_share, per108, per110) %&gt;% \n  # then, we create the positional and salience measure of European integration:\n  # we get the positional measure by substracting: per108 - per110\n  mutate(position_EU = per108 - per110,\n          # we get the salience measure by adding: per108 + per110\n         salience_EU = per108 + per110) %&gt;% \n  # now, we summarize the measures for the Eurosceptic parites, this is the same procedure as for the vote share before!\n    # before we summarize, we need to group our variables\n  group_by(country, election_date, Eurosceptic) %&gt;% \n  # now we can summarize, na.rm = TRUE omits NAs during the calculation\n  # this is important as some positions might be missing\n  summarize(position_EU = sum(position_EU, na.rm = TRUE),\n            salience_EU = sum(salience_EU, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'election_date'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n# again, we are only interested in Eurosceptic positions. Therefore, we filter accordingly:\nparl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  filter(Eurosceptic == 1)\n\n# instead of vote share, we want to show the position regarding European integration on the y axis!\nggplot(data = parl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = position_EU)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # we can just use the facet_wrap function to produce these small multiples!\n  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nNice! We managed to plot the “correct” data for Germany. However, we already know one limitation. The Republicans are not included in the Manifesto Project. Though, one has to note, that the party is not significant in recent years from an electoral perspective.\n\n\n\nAdd on\n\nYou can try to correct the data for France and Belgium if you want to.\n\n\n\nWhat about the salience and positions regarding European integration from non-Eurosceptic parties?\nIs there a correlation between vote shares and salience/positions regarding European integration?"

    "text": "This script\nThis script demonstrates how to merge data from different sources and transform it. We first load the data from The Populist and ParlGov. Second, we then transform the data and merge it.\nThe goal is to plot the vote share - we get this from the ParlGov data - of Eurosceptic parties - we get this from The Populist - from 1989 until 2022 for West European countries.\nIn the section Your turn: Add manifesto data, you can apply the learnings and merge our dataset with data from the Manifesto Project.\n\n\nSetup\nThe following code chunk makes sure that we load all the necessary packages. If they are not installed, the function installs and loads the packages for us.\n\n# load your packages here\npacman::p_load(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nLoad data\nWe first load the Populist data. We can load the data from our device, however, we can also download the data from the online source:\n\n# we use the read.csv2 function because the populist data is separated with a \";\"\npopulist &lt;- read.csv2(\"https://osf.io/download/7krzm/\")\n\nNext, we load the parlgov data:\n\n# here, we use the read.csv function because the separator is a \",\"\nparlgov &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www.parlgov.org/data/parlgov-development_csv-utf-8/view_election.csv\")\n\n\n\nInspect data\nWe have loaded the data.

Therefore, we have to check, if a party is actually Eurosceptic at the particular election.\n\n\n# we \"overwrite\" the parl_pop dataframe\nparl_pop &lt;- parl_pop %&gt;% \n  # we create a variable called \"Eurosceptic\" that takes the value \"1\" if \n  # it the party was considered eurosceptic before and after the election\n  mutate(Eurosceptic = case_when(election_date &gt;= eurosceptic_start & election_date &lt;= eurosceptic_end ~ 1,\n                                 TRUE ~ 0))\n\n\nNow, we can restrict the dataset to the variables we are interested in for plotting!\n\n\n# we create a new dataframe\nparl_pop_plot &lt;- parl_pop %&gt;% \n  # we select only the variables we need for our first plot\n  # and rename some of them in one step!\n  # dplyr:select(new_name = old_name)\n  dplyr::select(country = country_name.x,\n                election_date,\n                vote_share,\n                Eurosceptic) \n\n\nAs a last step, we need to summarize the vote shares of all Eurosceptic parties for each election.\n\n\n# We \"overwrite\" our existing data frame\nparl_pop_plot &lt;- parl_pop_plot %&gt;% \n  # before we summarize, we need to group our variables\n  group_by(country, election_date, Eurosceptic) %&gt;% \n  # now we can summarize, na.rm = TRUE omits NAs during the calculation\n  # this is important as some vote_shares are missing\n  summarize(Vote_share = sum(vote_share, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'election_date'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\nPlot\nFinally, we can plot the vote share of Eurosceptic parties in West European countries over time!\n\n# here, we are only interested in the vote share of Eurosceptic parties\n# We create a new dataframe called \"Eurosceptic_vote\"\nEurosceptic_vote &lt;- parl_pop_plot %&gt;% \n  # and filter that we keep the Eurosceptic observations\n  filter(Eurosceptic == 1) %&gt;% \n  # and change election_date to date format\n  mutate(election_date = as.Date(election_date))\n\n# Now we can plot these vote shares of Eurosceptic parties\n# we need out Eurosceptic_vote dataframe\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       # election_date at the x axis to show the development over time\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           # vote share on the y axis\n           y = Vote_share,\n           # we color by country\n           color = country,\n           # and tell ggplot that we need to group the observations by country\n           group = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nIs a smoothed trend better?\n\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = Vote_share,\n           color = country,\n           group = country)) +\n  # we set se=F to avoid confidence intervals as they would overlap too much\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiples?\n\n# how would you produce this plot?\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = Vote_share)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # we can just use the facet_wrap function to produce these small multiples!\n  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nHow could we make small multiples with sparklines?\n\n# how would you produce this plot?\nggplot(data = Eurosceptic_vote,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = Vote_share)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # again, we use facet_wrap, scales allows us that the y-axis can vary, ncol=3 just defines that we want to facet in 3 columns\n  facet_wrap(vars(country), scales = \"free_y\", ncol= 3) +\n  # theme_void gives us this \"sparkline\" look. We now can only concentrate on the trend. No labels etc.\n  theme_void() +\n  # this makes the header for each facet in bold text\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn: Add manifesto data\n\nFirst, you have to load the manifesto data. You can get the .csv file from ILIAS. Alternatively, you can create a free account here:https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/datasets/MPDS2023a\nIn addition, you need to load the party information from the ParlGov database. This is the right file: https://www.parlgov.org/data/parlgov-development_csv-utf-8/view_party.csv\n\n\n# load the parlgov party and the manifesto data here\nparlgov_parties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www.parlgov.org/data/parlgov-development_csv-utf-8/view_party.csv\")\nCMP &lt;- read.csv(\"MPDataset_MPDS2023a.csv\") \n\n\nNext, you have to get the identifier from the Parlgov party data (cmp), then merge it to the the existing parlgov election data. This allows you to merge the new dataframe with the Manifesto data!\n\nThink first about what identifiers you need to merge theses different dataframes!\n\n\n\n# first, we need the identifier in the parlgov data to merge our exisiting dataframe with the manifesto data! This column is called \"cmp\". You can only know this by inspecting the codebook!\n\n# we create a new dataframe called parlgov_parties\nparlgov_parties &lt;- parlgov_parties %&gt;% \n  # here, we are only interested in \"party_id\" to merge with our existing dataframe, and in \"cmp\" which allows us to link the existing dataframe including the parlgov election data and the populist data with the data from the Manifesto project.\n  select(party_id, cmp)\n\n# now we create the new dataframe called \"parl_pop_manifesto\": \n# we start with the existing dataframe parl_pop (this includes the parlgov election data and the populist data)\nparl_pop_parties &lt;- parl_pop %&gt;% \n  # we then join the parlgov_parties dataframe which includes only the parlgov party identifier and the identifier for the Manifesto data (cmp)\n  # we can left_join by only party_id because it is both in the parl_pop and the parlgov parties dataframe\n  left_join(parlgov_parties, by = c(\"party_id\"))  %&gt;%\n  # now, we could theoretically join the Manifesto data. However, we need another identifier! \n  # in both dataframes, the party identifier appears multiple times. Therefore, it is not clear how to match!\n  # we need a second identifier: the election date - we observe at each election the party once. \n  # this way, we have a unique identification. However, we need to make sure, that the election data has the same format in both dataframes.\n  # it is easiest, to transform both election date variables to the date format:\n  mutate(election_date = as.Date(election_date))\n\n# here, we transform the election date (edate) in the Manifesto Project data\nCMP &lt;- CMP %&gt;% \n  # Note, that the date is provided in a different format here!\n  # We have to tell the as.Date() function the structure: \"%d/%m/%Y\" -&gt; this means for example: dd.mm.YYYY \n  mutate(edate = as.Date(edate,  format = \"%d/%m/%Y\"))\n\n# finally we can join the data frames\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  # the party identifier in the CMP dataframe is called \"party\"\n  left_join(CMP, by = c(\"cmp\" = \"party\", \"election_date\" = \"edate\"))\n\n\nNow, you can proceed as before. Select the relevant variables and plot the salience and positions regarding European integration for the Eurosceptic parties. Here, you can see how these variables are defined by the Manifesto project: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/documents/visualizations\n\nWe can add up the variables per108 and per110 to get a salience measure of European Integration (Salience): per108 + per110\nWe can substract per110 from per108 to get a positional measure of European Integration (Position): per108 - per110\n\n\n\n# select and transform relevant data\n# we \"overwrite\" the parl_pop_CMP dataframe\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  # and only selet the following variables\n  select(country = country_name.x, election_date, Eurosceptic, vote_share, per108, per110) %&gt;% \n  # then, we create the positional and salience measure of European integration:\n  # we get the positional measure by substracting: per108 - per110\n  mutate(position_EU = per108 - per110,\n          # we get the salience measure by adding: per108 + per110\n         salience_EU = per108 + per110) %&gt;% \n  # now, we summarize the measures for the Eurosceptic parites, this is the same procedure as for the vote share before!\n    # before we summarize, we need to group our variables\n  group_by(country, election_date, Eurosceptic) %&gt;% \n  # now we can summarize, na.rm = TRUE omits NAs during the calculation\n  # this is important as some positions might be missing\n  summarize(position_EU = sum(position_EU, na.rm = TRUE),\n            salience_EU = sum(salience_EU, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'election_date'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can plot for example the positions regarding European integration from Eurosceptic parties over time.\nFirst, the position:\n\n! Do you see any strange patterns?\n\n\n\n# again, we are only interested in Eurosceptic positions. Therefore, we filter accordingly:\nparl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  filter(Eurosceptic == 1)\n\n# instead of vote share, we want to show the position regarding European integration on the y axis!\nggplot(data = parl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = position_EU)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # we can just use the facet_wrap function to produce these small multiples!\n  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the aggregated position for France are always zero. The same is true for Germany and Belgium after some time. What went wrong?\n\nUnfortunately, the party identifiers in the parlgov data set seem not to be updated regularly to match the Manifesto party identifiers. You can read more up on this here: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/tutorials/parlgov_merge\nThis means that we would have to adapt the party identifiers of Eurosceptic parties in our parl_pop_parties dataframe before we merge it with the CMP dataframe.\nFor France, we have a different problem. There are two rounds of elections. Unfortunately, the parlgov and Manifesto project use different rounds as election dates. One easy solution might be to transform our data variable to just the year format (e.g., YYYY). This way, we can avoid the problem that the exact dates do not match.\n\nThis is a great example that it is essential that we always check our data!\nAs an example, let’s correct the German data together. How would I tackle such a case?\n\nFirst: Google! This would lead me to the already mentioned blogpost: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/tutorials/parlgov_merge. Here, I could get the right code.\nWhat if Google does not help? We need to check it in detail:\n\n\n\n# first, we want to have a look at the Eurosceptic German parties before we merge with the CMP dataframe\n# this is: parl_pop_parties\n\nparl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  filter(country_name.x == \"Germany\",\n         Eurosceptic == 1) %&gt;% \n  select(country_name.x, election_date, party_name.x, cmp)\n\n   country_name.x election_date                party_name.x   cmp\n1         Germany    1990-12-02             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n2         Germany    1990-12-02            Die Republikaner    NA\n3         Germany    1994-10-16             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n4         Germany    1994-10-16            Die Republikaner    NA\n5         Germany    1998-09-27             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n6         Germany    1998-09-27            Die Republikaner    NA\n7         Germany    2002-09-22             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n8         Germany    2002-09-22            Die Republikaner    NA\n9         Germany    2005-09-18             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n10        Germany    2009-09-27             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n11        Germany    2013-09-22             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n12        Germany    2013-09-22 Alternative für Deutschland    NA\n13        Germany    2017-09-24 Alternative für Deutschland    NA\n14        Germany    2017-09-24             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n15        Germany    2021-09-26 Alternative für Deutschland    NA\n16        Germany    2021-09-26             PDS | Die Linke 41221\n\n\n\nWe can see that “Die Republikaner” and the “AfD” have no cmp identifier! Also we know that the cmp identifier for The Left is 41221. Now, we need to check the party id in the Manifesto data frame:\n\n\nCMP_test &lt;- CMP %&gt;% \n  filter(countryname == \"Germany\",\n         edate &gt;= 1990-12-02) %&gt;% \n  # the party identifier is here called \"party\"\n  select(countryname, edate, partyname, party) \n\n# check the unique party names in the CMP_test dataframe\nunique(CMP_test$partyname)\n\n [1] \"Social Democratic Party of Germany\"               \n [2] \"Free Democratic Party\"                            \n [3] \"Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union\"\n [4] \"The Greens\"                                       \n [5] \"Greens/Alliance‘90\"                               \n [6] \"Party of Democratic Socialism\"                    \n [7] \"Alliance‘90/Greens\"                               \n [8] \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\"          \n [9] \"The Left\"                                         \n[10] \"Pirates\"                                          \n[11] \"Alternative for Germany\"                          \n[12] \"South Schleswig Voters’ Union\"                    \n\n\n\nWe can see that the Manifesto data includes these parties: “The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism”, “The Left”, and the “Alternative for Germany”. However, it does not include “Die Republikaner”. Let’s check now the party identifier for the Left party:\n\n\nCMP_test %&gt;% \n  filter(partyname %in% c(\"Alternative for Germany\", \n                          \"The Left\",\n                          \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\")) %&gt;% \n  select(partyname, party) %&gt;% \n  unique()\n\n                                partyname party\n1 The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism 41222\n2                                The Left 41223\n4                 Alternative for Germany 41953\n\n\n\nWe see that the identifiers for the Left and its predecessor are 41222 and 41223. In parlgov it is 41221!\nThe identifier for the Alternative for Germany is 41953.\nOne approach to fix our problem with the German data can be to change the party identifier for the AfD in our “parl_pop_parties” dataframe accordingly. And the party identifier in the Manifesto dataframe for the variations of the Left. We can do this easily with the case_when() function:\n\n\n# we \"overwrite\" our parl_pop_parties dataframe\nparl_pop_parties &lt;- parl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  # and update the cmp column:\n  # when party_name.x equals \"Alternative für Deutschland\" we replace the value with 41953\n  # otherwise (TRUE) we keep the original cmp value.\n  mutate(cmp = case_when(party_name.x == \"Alternative für Deutschland\" ~ 41953,\n                         TRUE ~ cmp))\n\n# now we change the identifiers for the Left party variations in the Manifesto dataframe:\nCMP &lt;- CMP %&gt;% \n  # when party is either \"The Left \" or \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\" then replace with 41221\n  # Otherwise: keep the original party identifier!\n  mutate(party = case_when(partyname == \"The Left\" | partyname == \"The Left. Party of Democratic Socialism\" ~ 41221,\n                           TRUE ~ party))\n\n\nAfter updating the identifiers, we should be able to run the code from above, merge the data and plot it!\n\n\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_parties %&gt;% \n  # the party identifier in the CMP dataframe is called \"party\"\n  left_join(CMP, by = c(\"cmp\" = \"party\", \"election_date\" = \"edate\"))\n\n# select and transform relevant data\n# we \"overwrite\" the parl_pop_CMP dataframe\nparl_pop_CMP &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  # and only selet the following variables\n  select(country = country_name.x, election_date, Eurosceptic, vote_share, per108, per110) %&gt;% \n  # then, we create the positional and salience measure of European integration:\n  # we get the positional measure by substracting: per108 - per110\n  mutate(position_EU = per108 - per110,\n          # we get the salience measure by adding: per108 + per110\n         salience_EU = per108 + per110) %&gt;% \n  # now, we summarize the measures for the Eurosceptic parites, this is the same procedure as for the vote share before!\n    # before we summarize, we need to group our variables\n  group_by(country, election_date, Eurosceptic) %&gt;% \n  # now we can summarize, na.rm = TRUE omits NAs during the calculation\n  # this is important as some positions might be missing\n  summarize(position_EU = sum(position_EU, na.rm = TRUE),\n            salience_EU = sum(salience_EU, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'election_date'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n# again, we are only interested in Eurosceptic positions. Therefore, we filter accordingly:\nparl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic &lt;- parl_pop_CMP %&gt;% \n  filter(Eurosceptic == 1)\n\n# instead of vote share, we want to show the position regarding European integration on the y axis!\nggplot(data = parl_pop_CMP_Eurosceptic,\n       aes(x = election_date,\n           y = position_EU)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # we can just use the facet_wrap function to produce these small multiples!\n  facet_wrap(vars(country)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nNice! We managed to plot the “correct” data for Germany. However, we already know one limitation. The Republicans are not included in the Manifesto Project. Though, one has to note, that the party is not significant in recent years from an electoral perspective.\n\n\n\nAdd on\n\nYou can try to correct the data for France and Belgium if you want to.\n\n\n\nWhat about the salience and positions regarding European integration from non-Eurosceptic parties?\nIs there a correlation between vote shares and salience/positions regarding European integration?"

Werte Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Sehr geehrte Frau Lehmann, ehemalige Kreistagskollegin, herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Einzug in den Bundestag und auf eine gute gemeinsame Zusammenarbeit für den Heimatwahlkreis!  Ich komme gerade zurück aus Paris.  Es war eine Dienstreise. Ich war bei der Sitzung der Parlamentarischen Versammlung des Europarats. Es ging um Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit. Ich weiß, da haben gewisse Parteien hier in diesem Haus leider gewisse Berührungsängste.  Ich war der einzige deutsche Abgeordnete dort – leider. Auf jeden Fall: In Paris demonstrieren und streiken die Leute gerade. Sie demonstrieren und streiken gegen genau die Politik, die in Deutschland existiert und die Macron dort einführen will.  Macron will faktisch die deutsche Rente nach Frankreich  kopieren, genauso wie Ursula von der Leyen den Green New Deal von irgendwelchen US-amerikanischen Ökokommunistinnen kopiert und Merkel den Politikstil des Zentralkomitees. Diese Arbeitsattitüde der Großen Koalition bringt niemanden voran.  Die Leute gehen auf die Straße, weil sie sehen: Das bringt uns in Armut. Wenn dieses System kommt, dann bedeutet die Zukunft Armut, und das ist leider die Gegenwart in Deutschland. Insofern danke ich Ihnen von der Linken, dass Sie das Thema heute auf die Tagesordnung gesetzt haben;  denn es ist eine Schande für Deutschland, wenn immer mehr Rentner zur Tafel gehen müssen, um überhaupt überleben zu können.  Das zeigt doch: Es stimmt etwas nicht zwischen Einnahmen und Ausgaben.  Es kommt erstens zu wenig rein, und zweitens steigen die  Ausgaben zu stark. Und das hat natürlich mit dieser makroökonomischen Politik zu tun, die insbesondere von den  regierenden Parteien hier betrieben worden ist und betrieben wird. Ein großes Stichwort heißt „Riester-Dämpfung“. Die Reform, die SPD und Grüne – ich spreche es offen an – damals eingeführt haben: Die Leute werden am Rande alle noch ein bisschen riestern, und dann werden sie letztendlich eine private Vorsorge haben. – Pustekuchen! Ich frage mich schon, wie die Bundesregierung überhaupt  noch die Frechheit besitzen kann, im Rentenversicherungsbericht mit 4 Prozent per annum Verzinsung für die Riester-Rente zu rechnen. Wir wissen alle – das IVFP hat es nachgewiesen –, es kommen zwischen 0 und 2 Prozent Rendite raus, nicht 4 Prozent. Deswegen werden die Leute kaum mehr ausgezahlt bekommen, als sie eingezahlt haben, wenn sie in Rente gehen. Das bedeutet: Dieser private Vorsorgeteil scheitert, die gesetzliche Umlagerente haben Sie im Prinzip nach unten reformiert, auf einen niedrigen Standard reformiert, und dass wir heute Altersarmut zu beklagen haben, ist kein Zufall, sondern das Ergebnis Ihrer Politik. Das haben Sie als Ziel definiert.  Es ist übrigens kein Ausweg, dass die Rentner im Alter einfach weiterarbeiten, Herr Kober. Ich weiß nicht, warum Sie das formulieren. Auch in einem Zeitungsinter-Norbert Kleinwächter view haben Sie das formuliert. Vielleicht betreibt die FDP ja demnächst einen Sarglieferservice für Büros. Ich weiß nicht, was das soll. Menschen haben im Alter ein gutes Auskommen verdient, und dafür müssen wir in der Politik sorgen.  Jetzt kommt die schwere Aufgabe für die Zukunft – viele von Ihnen haben darüber gesprochen –: Wir müssen Löhne anheben, wir müssen für Bildung sorgen usw. Das ist richtig, und das ist wichtig für die nächste Generation.  Aber wir haben schon jetzt ein Altersarmutsproblem bei  den Leuten, die bereits in Rente sind. Und da müssen wir letztendlich mit anderen ökonomischen Mitteln herangehen.  Wir haben zweierlei Lösungskomplexe, die ich Ihnen ganz kurz vorstelle. Das eine ist ganz klar: die Ausgaben zu reduzieren. Wir haben jede Menge Dinge, die die ganz normalen Menschen in unserem Land immer mehr belasten. Ich sage nur: Ökospinnereien aller möglichen Arten, neue Heizungsverpflichtungen, neue Autoverpflichtungen, Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz. Das muss weg. Das treibt unseren Strompreis in die Höhe, und diesen Strom zahlen natürlich auch unsere Rentner. Wir sollten die Grundsteuer abschaffen. Wir müssen den Mehrwertsteuersatz senken. Das sind doch alles Dinge, die zu Ausgaben führen. Und vor allem: Wir müssen raus aus diesem Euro; denn der ist die Grundlage der großen Probleme, die wir in Deutschland haben.  Wir haben den Euro mit einer ständigen Geldmengensteigerung. 13 Billionen ist die Geldmenge aktuell. Die EZB druckt jedes Jahr eine halbe Billion nach. Das wird einfach in den Markt gestreut, und zwar nicht an alle, sondern an Investoren. Die investieren wieder in Immobilien, damit werden die Wohnungen teurer, damit werden die Mieten wieder teurer, und diese Mieten müssen natürlich auch unsere Rentner bezahlen. Deswegen sind sie am Ende dann arm. Diese Situation haben wir. Wir haben die Abwertung der Währung, sodass unsere Löhne und unsere Renten tatsächlich immer weniger wert sind.  Das ist natürlich ein Problem, weil das letztendlich unsere Währung billiger macht und Investoren aus dem Ausland anlockt, was dann letztendlich wiederum zu einer Preissteigerung im Sachwertesegment führt.   Und wir haben die Negativzinspolitik, die auch ein  Grund dafür ist, dass Riester nicht funktioniert. Die Leute kriegen keine Zinsen mehr auf ihre Spareinlagen. Die Leute können gar nicht mehr ordentlich fürs Alter vorsorgen. Und am Ende sind sie arm, weil unsere deutschen Rentner im Prinzip für die insolventen Broker aus dem Ausland zahlen. Das ist doch die Wahrheit der Politik, die die Regierung hier an den Tag legt.  Deswegen sagen wir: Runter mit den Ausgaben und raus aus dem Euro.  Das ist die wahre makroökonomische Lösung für das Problem der Altersarmut in Deutschland. Herzlichen Dank.\""
