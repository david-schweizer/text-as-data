# Enjoy the Easter break! 

## But keep in mind:

- Work on **Assignment 2. The deadline is 28.04.2025 13:00**. Feel free to get in touch with me via e-mail about anything unclear or when you are stuck.

- Take the Easter break to think a bit more about what you want to work on in the term paper and what method might be suitable. By now, you have encountered various text-as-data methods: dictionaries, unsupervised, and supervised approaches.
