# To Do's before our session

-   Finish the exercise from last session. Try out different dictionaries!

-   Have a look at the introduction and the theoretical part of Rebecca Kittel's paper "[Simply Speaking? Language Complexity among (Non-)Populist Actors in Parliamentary Debates](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/simply-speaking-language-complexity-among-nonpopulist-actors-in-parliamentary-debates/30B241C0182677F07A6ABD31BC519831)". We will replicate some of the analysis in today's session.
