# To Do's before our session

- None. We will have an introductory session to get to know each other, go
over the plan for the semester, and talk about both your and
my expectations for the course.

- Although our sessions are in the "Methodenlabor" and you
will have access to computers, I encourage you to bring your
own laptop (if you have one). That way, you can also work on
assignments during the semester and the final examination at
home. We will have time tomorrow to ensure everybody can
install a working version of R and RStudio.
